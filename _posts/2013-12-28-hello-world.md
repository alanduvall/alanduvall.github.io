It has been a long time coming and I am happy to say I finally have a blog up on the interwebs. Now if only I could get on "the google"

Speaking of "the google", I am challenging myself to a 90 day challenge where by I plan to conquer the first page of google with only information relating to the true "Alan Duvall" 
Now the interesting aspect of this challenge is that it truly ranges from 0 to 100 in terms of difficulty depending on your name. And unfortunately for me I also have to compete with a legitimate accounting business.  I put my odds of succeeding at 85%. As you continue to follow me in my journey through this challenge as well as future challenges please <a href="http://ctt.ec/Ob9Rc " target="_blank">Click To Tweet</a>
